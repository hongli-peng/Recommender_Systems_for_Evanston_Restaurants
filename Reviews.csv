1,Jacquelyn Rigatti,Barn Steakhouse,5,"Excellent meal in a warm atmosphere! The space feels intimate and warm despite it being a high ceiling, concrete floored barn‚Ä¶ great design. Also manages to feel casual and elegant at the same time, with both the design and ambience. The meal was excellent. We shared the chopped salad, filet mignon with horseradish which was cooked perfectly and the red wine glaze is an excellent touch, the robuchon mashed potatoes and mushrooms which were both excellent sides, the crab spaghetti which has a spice to it and a ton of perfectly cooked crab, and the pecan streusel carrot cake. Everything was amazing, would recommend every dish. Worth the trip from the city up to Evanston for a meal that rivals the best steakhouses in Chicago, including all those hard to get resy Hogsalt restaurants.",2022-11-22 00:00:00,1998.0,Single,No,,,,Medium,On Foot,No

13,Jennifer Armagost,Picnic,5,"Mmmmmmmmmmm!!! That's the sound of me eating the best salad in the universe, the ""New School Chicken Salad"" from Picnic. The combination of the cheese, grapes, chicken, greens, candied nuts, pickled shallots, etc. is incredible. See the before and after photos attached to this review. Tied with the salad is the lemon tart. W-O-W. The service is very good (it is a take-out establishment, but the comfy couch and chair plus the beautiful d√©cor make it a very pleasant place to wait for your meal to be prepared) and the prices are more than reasonable.

We started with pink pomelo salad and Crispy Brussels sprouts. Then we got two main dishes to round out our meal. The short ribs and shrimp noodles were so good!

17,Denise Garfield,Steak n' Shake,5,I knew good Steak n Shakes could exist. It literally feels chef driven right now. I‚Äôm now incredibly addicted to the triple steak burger.

They're pretty good to just put something on your stomach, but for the price...I'd opt for something else.",2022-09-21 00:00:00,1999.0,Single,No,,206.0,172.0,Medium,Car Owner,No
22,Richard Eyler,Nakorn,3,"Best described as ""contemporary"", NaKorn serves up Thai flavors without the comfort.
Wasn't expecting to see ginger bourbon popcorn chicken on the appetizer list but it wasnt bad. Tapioca pearl crackers with minced chicken and shrimp relish was the highlight of my meal - simple with complex flavors and well portioned.
Both the coconut poached seafood and coconut curry braised chicken were tasty, but I would've been just as happy if not happier with Tom Yum Gung and Panang Gai.
Mildly disappointed the dessert options didnt include Kao Niew Ma Muang. The chocolate mousse was okay.
It's the kind of place you'd go to experience something different because of the curb appeal, but doesn't inspire me to come back.",2022-10-07 00:00:00,1945.0,Married,Yes,,188.0,181.0,Medium,Car Owner,No

40,Delores Davis,Mt. Everest Restaurant,4,"As a resident of Evanston for several years now, I‚Äôve been to this restaurant many times. The food is south Asian ( Nepali and Indian ) but more ‚ÄúAmericanized‚Äù ( read : a bit on the bland side of things )to suit the audience for the restaurant. But, it still manages to get the balance of spice and flavors for the most part. This time we had the momos, pakoras, tandoori roti and mutter paneer. Was a little bit disappointed that the paneer wasn‚Äôt as soft as it is usually. But otherwise, the food tasted good and service was quick too. I‚Äôve been to their buffet lunch ( pre covid) on several occasions and it was a great value for money.

The saving grace is the food is still good, and the waiters are polite. The wait time has gone up quiet a bit. They‚Äôre serving food in disposable containers due to COVID which would have been admirable, had been not been for the total lack of effort with the flimsy containers and poor quality cutler. Made it difficult for the waiters to serve and patrons to eat. We sent one of the dishes back since it wasn‚Äôt good (can happen to the best of chefs), only to be confronted by the unhappy owner, ruining our evening. We requested that there be no sprouts since one of our guests is pregnant, sure enough one of the dishes had sprouts.

No issues with the delivery service, it is them providing the wrong salad to the delivery driver and suggesting that YOU come back to get the right one. I gave them a second chance and they call me AFTER the driver has already picked up my food to say they forgot to add the protein? They did attempt to call the delivery service and the driver but the response was ""I tried, they will provide a credit for the protein."" Okay...no attempt to make it right ""Next salad is on us!"" or ""Next protein is on us, so sorry for the inconvenience."" Not once but twice there were issues. It was like ""eh..we tried.""

The pastry was good, but the almond filling tasted odd ‚Ä¶ maybe too much flour filler? The outdoor seating was very nice.

185,Michael Jennings,Hecky's BBQ,1,"First time visiting. I'm from the south Oklahoma to Texas area. We have better expectations.When I walked in, I told them I wanted to taste the meat not the sauce. Did not ask for their bbq sauce, they asked, so, I stated go ahead and place it on the side and I might try it. Meaning do not put it on the meat. I ordered pulled chicken and some ribs. Ribs are cut into cube slices. That was a turn off, ok, meat is somewhat tasty but small bones because it's cut into cubes. Be careful and don't choke on that one. The chicken. Pfft. Bbq sauce was added. I didn't want it, told them I want meat not sauce. Told them in pounds of how much chicken, yet they made it into a sandwich. It had sauce all over the pulled chicken. Sauce is too sweet and not that good, for me, if you like sweet, you might like theirs. Not for me. They told me in the beginning or to my understanding it would not have sauce. Next, I ordered peach cobbler, it's cold, not fresh, and a lot of bread, very soft and doughy, not cook fully, I have only 3 peach slices and the entire container with lots of dough. I do not have any anticipations of going back. Complete waste of $35+. I tried to call them back but was put on direct hold. Didn't even have hospitality to ask if I had the to time to be placed on hold. Unprofessional for me.",2022-08-19 00:00:00,1984.0,Married,Yes,,275.0,156.0,Low,On Foot,No

However, the food, at the end of the day, is what costs them a star. I've had equally good presentations of ""pub grub"" in other places. Theirs is nothing special.
Their beer list is not broad but it is good if you like the style they are featuring (they do a great ""black 'n tan"").

232,Anthony Laford,Alcove,2,"Went to the Alcove for an 8pm dinner reservation with my partner and his parents for his ma‚Äôs birthday. The food was very good but the service was embarrassing and careless: Our server was disengaged. Twice, he walked off right as we began asking him for something. The food runner had no idea what was going on. I can‚Äôt imagine this place not having position numbers. We asked him for share plates for our salads and he forgot. Half the entrees came out and we waited about 10 minutes for the rest. Our water glasses sat empty again and again. After both first and second courses we sat with empty plates piled up as staff walked right on past. My guess is because we made an 8pm reservation, the staff were mentally checked out by that point.

237,Freeman Nguyen,Burger King,2,I've been going to this location for a long time. The staff has always been kind and professional. My issue which occurred today was one of sanitation. I witnessed the drive thru associate take my money in cash to then provide me with my respective change in cash while proceeding to walk over to the food area and gather then bag my food. I was disgusted. Monetary forms of payment collected have exchanged hands 1000+ times which carries all sorts of germs etc. For that same person to touch my food and then hand it to me right afterward without putting on gloves or washing their hands is unacceptable and not cleanly.

The salmon was absolutely cooked perfectly, but the plate was a bit limited in their offering with the meal. Nice helping of rice, but only 2 broccolis and 2 carrots. That was disappointing.",2022-08-26 00:00:00,1966.0,Married,Yes,,213.0,196.0,Medium,Car Owner,No

Thali is more than enough for one person. On top of that you can refill it without extra cost for individual with heavy diet.

Arrived to a very small line just to wait and wait because online orders came in first.
When my turn arrived, I asked for the chicken protein, and I received a half empty spoon. Asked politely and I was turned down by saying that it was 4oz even though was I got served wasn't even half of that.
Now comes the turn of the other condiments and I ask for corn and I'm told there is no more...okay ...
I'm about to pay, 4 seconds after the last fast and they just put new corn, so I ask politely again. I get turned down, my bowl is closed so I can't. Had to suggest a side cup and who seemed the manager forced this person to serve me.
Overall a very bad experience. Seems like the people at this location don't want to work and do it with a very bad attitude.

Even better, he insisted on asking repeatedly exactly how many we wanted. I usually just say ""a bunch"" so I don't appear picky and to be quick. Very pleased to have found someone that understood that I have very specific ketchup to food ratio needs, I asked for the seven ketchup packets I required to complete my meal. We went back to work, rather eager to begin our fine meal, and horrifically find there to be nine ketchup packets.

436,Thomas Hagerman,Cozy Noodles and Rice,1,"Beware: Deceptive Billing. They tack on upwards of 20% gratuity to your bill even if you are a party of 2. They will not bring you an itemized bill to your table. Instead you are directed to pay at the counter on your way out but they also will not give you an itemized bill at the counter. They only give you a receipt with a total. If you don‚Äôt notice because they engage you in conversation, you end up adding another tip. You end up paying more in tips than you pay in food. I think that they do it this way on purpose. It is unethical, a terrible way to run a business and these types of practices should be illegal. I dined at Cozy Noodle in Evanston on January 12, 2023 and will not be returning. Since I didn‚Äôt notice until much later, I tipped generously on top of the generous tip that they decided to secretly add to the bill for a table of 2. I will only patronize the Cozy Noodle on Sheffield Ave in Chicago near Wrigleyville moving forward. The menu is the same. The food is better. The owners and staff are friendlier.

The vibe is relaxed and casual and reminded me of an unpretentious speakeasy with a seafood-heavy menu. We ended up ordering all appetizers - the calamari was delicious even though some of it was a tad overcooked. It had a crumbly breading that was well seasoned. We also had a basil pomodoro goat cheese dip that was pure heaven. Crab cakes were meh (not bad, but not crisp like I prefer... they were wildly thick which might be a 5‚òÜ for others). And the shrimp boil was perfectly cooked but mildly seasoned. The bar was hopping due to an event and our poor waitress, who was also the bartender, did a phenomenal job juggling all the chaos.

My favorite was suadero, chorizo infused brisket. Then pambazo, a chorizo sandwich, the bread alone had an insane amount of flavor. And tlacoyo: bean stuffed tortilla covered in cheese and cactus (nopalitos), all delicious!

We've been to several fine dining venues, and the food here did not impress us. The only exception was the dessert. Both the desserts we ordered were delicious. We got Groupon for this establishment. Please look at your bills!! They initially charged us without the Groupon. When we mentioned it, the waiter took it back and removed the charge for the 5 course meal. However, there was still a charge for dessert. Then we pointed out again that the desserts are in the 5 course meal. He went back and removed that. After that we were still left with a $100 plus bill. We ordered a side that was 17 and 1 glass of wine that was 16. They added a 50 dollar tip. There was a restaurant surcharge on top of that, along with a bunch of food taxes. We again asked to remove the restaurant surcharge, and they did. The only reason for the 2 star is because they removed the extra charges when we asked. However, they really shouldn't make so many mistakes. The staff were all friendly! Indoor decor was boring.

They were covered in way too much salt, not crispy at all, and some weren't cooked all the way through. I like supporting smaller fast food places, but I won't be coming back here.

But the wait wasn‚Äôt too bad, maybe 45 minutes on Sunday brunch time early. Worth it. Got their peach blueberry French toast (seasonal) and veggie hash (mandatory).

476,Jon Swartwood,Campagnola,4,"Great little Italian restaurant to tuck into. Both indoor and back patio dining is available. We sat at the back patio. Great prompt service with good expertise. It‚Äôs a popular destination so make reservations. The highlight of the show was the scallop dish. If it‚Äôs on the menu and you like seafood don‚Äôt skip it! Great wine list. What impressed me more was how our waitress was attuned and kind; my friend asked for an off the menu cocktail that‚Äôs diluted since she can‚Äôt drink much. It was met with zero resistance; and delivered promptly. Now that‚Äôs customer centric hospitality. We had the arugula and beet salads - both perfect for summer and sharing. Portions are well sized for sharing, especially if you like to try more dishes. It is reasonably priced. Parking is easy but it‚Äôs street parking, we found a spot within 2 min walking distance. It‚Äôs located in a good safe area with other restaurants on same street. If you happen to be in Evanston or visiting definitely check this place out, you will have a great dinner.

I immediately walked out and tried ordering from home. A Mexican lady speaking broken English answers the phone. I explain my case. She did nothing to accommodate me nor apologize. I tried ordering food but she hung up. I call back and talk to the ""supposable owner"" you wanna talk about rude, this lady kept hanging up on me when I tried explaining my original treatment. It was supposed to be my first time there. Anyways, if this lady is still the owner be aware of her negative treatment to a first time customer. I will never give this place a penny of my money. They kept hanging up on me when I was trying to order but also let them know that your bus boy wearing rubber gloves holding a mop shouldn't approach customers. So another privileged Evanston owner that doesn't take kind to male Latinos who just want a bite to eat. Because that is what I am and that is what people see me as. It's truly a discrimination against Latino males. Evanston favors white, liberal females. I'm sorry I'm the wrong gender but I can change.

Also served were grilled veggies that probably were cooked in the drippings of meat - absolutely amazing. The waiter also jokingly suggested we try the ""best chicken in Chicago"". We ordered a large plate of the classic grilled chicken that looked reddish from the outside, and it was supremely good and completely moist throughout. In all, they are hands down masters of their cuisine.

Our appetizer took another 20 minutes as we watched other tables arrive and be served by another server. (One party that came in 1/2 hour after we did left 1/2 hour before we did). The hostess noticed we just sitting there and took our drink order. More wait for 2 glasses of wine.The server and hostess discussed which one would get this pour. Our entres of salmon and (tough little) lamb chops took so long that I ordered more bread and (delicious) soup. It had been over an hour with no dinner. The only other time we dined here the simple entrees took so long to come out we were comped (not having complained) the dessert souflees by the apologetic server!! Our seats by the bar were noisy with crashing around in the under-bar refrigerator to the point my calm husband asked if construction was happening behind his back. There is NO busing help so servers clear and reset tables AND SERVE; AND make drinks even if they don't really know how! There is no bar tender!

709,Lori Cormier,P√¢tisserie Coralie,1,"Honestly what is with the staff? We came in 40 minutes before close, to celebrate a romantic milestone - so a French patisserie seemed like a cute idea. Vibe was not romantic or Parisian on this day. Years ago I spent HUNDREDS on pastry here for my daughter's sweet sixteen and am actually a little heartbroken that yesterday's experience put such a bad taste in my mouth and messed with my sweet opinion of the place. The second we sit and my husband goes to the counter, some guy YELLS ""just letting everyone know we're closing in half an hour!"" in the manner that a dive bar gives last call. Bordered on aggressive!? Like, he yelled it SO LOUD my ear drums wobbled and it was only us and one other quiet couple in this tiny space. Just obliterated the atmosphere. I would have walked out if I hadn't promised our son a treat.  Consider acting *appreciative* that a nice little family of three comes in to drop $50 when it's Superbowl Sunday and business is slow. Not romantic. No music. Dingy and mismatched furniture. Dirty floor. There were also strange rules about having to buy a chocolate cake if you buy another flavor? Weird. I expected high romance and cleanliness. Marketing did not align with the experience. Bennison's  bakery is down the street with better macarons and a can-do and welcoming vibe instead of huffing and puffing about a well dressed couple with their son forty minutes before closing. The guy with the long hair and bad attitude also should have had his hair back, it's an eatery. I'll never go back and the weird branding cards in all the cakes are obviously for marketing on social media and kind of tacky.",2022-04-03 00:00:00,1988.0,Married,Yes,,149.0,182.0,High,Car Owner,No

We ordered few entrees and appetizers to share all at once! Fried rice is perfect, not to greasy with lots of fresh veggies. Salt and pepper squid is amazing dish, that we can never skip, not fried too much, salty enough, but not too much.. Also never trued dry szechuan sausage, reminded us of European dried pork sausage, but Chinese is more spiced and salty!

Goat cheese in tomato sauce is always the most favourite dish on the table, so complex and great combination with toasted bread. Octopus was fresh and cooked god, but calamari we didn't care, chewy a bit and sauce wasn't our taste. But all in all it's great experience and everyone should try Tapas!

We asked to keep food medium. We ordered Shangrila noodles, but it came out so spicy that I couldn't eat. The waiter took the plate away telling me they will make a new one. I got the same noodles with tons of tomato sauce added. It made the noodles so sour, tangy, sweet, soggy and overcooked to lower down the spiciness from the food I was served previously. Cauliflower Manchurian were also sweet and no crispy at all. Should have taken a picture from the bowl to see difference.

It gets booked so make a reservation or go after 8pm. It's not cheap, but still a good value compared to other local restaurants of the same caliber. Would like to see some cheaper wine glasses - but I get it, they don't need to get more people in the door and the don't want the drunk mom party filling up the bar (that is what Union is for). Great place and good for the neighborhood.

I have ordered take-out from this new location during the height of COVID-19, but this review is for dining in for the first time since their move. Pictured and ordered here are Crab Rangoon, Fried Shrimp Shumai, Orange Chicken (served w/ Steamed White Rice on the side), and Tom Yum Chicken Soup (also served w/ Steamed White Rice on the side) (video also posted in my Photos and Joy Yee's Photos>Videos). First time having the Tom Yum Chicken Soup and it was a very large portion (can serve 2, I think) and had a nice level of heat! Would order the Tom Yum Shrimp Soup next time.

Asked about getting cheese and were brought a slice of blue cheese. When I asked about other cheeses they said they were out and the blue cheese was better than the white cheddar that they were out of. Choices? Bartenders were attentive and kind.

The credit card receipt comes out of the little machine with a space for a gratuity. You are not told that the total already includes a service charge of over 20%. You are never given an itemized bill. I think many of the good reviews are by people who do not know that they have left two tips. I didn't know for a long time. The food is four stars.

Unfortunately, I simply cannot find any resemblance to any of them. I really do appreciate the service I received here, however, I cannot recommend NaKorn to anyone looking for an authentic Thai food experience, especially at this price point. The seafood in coconut curry tasted completely watered down and the portion is insultingly small. The other dish I tried is the streak with yellow curry. Again, quite a big miss for me. The meat was nothing to write home about, and the curry lacked serious flavoring of any sort. I was also quite puzzled to see basil being served as a garnish as opposed to cooked into the dish. As a dish, neither the curry or steak complemented one another.

850,William Thompson,Campagnola,5,"After living in Evanston for more than a decade we finally patronized Campagnola. The service and food is excellent! It has a small menu which tells us that everything is freshly prepped. As a party of 5 we ordered 3 starters: Caesar salad (with an anchovy), grilled octopus, and bruschetta. For entrees we had grilled duck with polenta and a cherry reduction, short ribs with broccoli and creamy potatoes, a mushroom linguini, roasted chicken in a white wine reduction, and cellantani with tomatoes and mozzarella. For dessert we had lemon tart, chocolate mousse, and bread pudding. All the dishes were great. Even with a small menu (which is preferred), there was quite a variety of flavors from which to choose. This is a great place in south Evanston to treat yourself. They know how to handle a full dining room. All the service staff were well organized. Everything was served in proper order, with proper utensils, and good attention to details - even the water was kept full for everyone.

While my beer wasn't room temp, it certainly wasn't cold either. I ordered the bangers and mash. Very clearly from frozen, flavorless. The gravy was okay, hopefully that wasn't frozen too.

887,Mary Denyes,Picnic,1,"Went in 12:05 to pick up a grubhub order that was to be ready at 12:10. Asked an employee at 12:20 when my order would be up? His response is, ""I don't know!! A couple mins. ""....smh, I guess it was just tooooo much work for him to go check on the name, so I decided to just unassign myself and take the acceptance hit. I'm sure a restaurant like this benefits hugely from delivery services since they advertise online orders only. My gripe is why is the order not ready for pick up at the pick up time us drivers are given?? I understand being short staffed or understaffed etc,etc. But for bloody sake, if you're understaffed and can't handle the work, then dont use the delivery service. The only ppl getting stiffed in this is the drivers. Anybody that grubhubs knows that you have to schedule blocks of time between 1 to 3 hrs. So imagine the frustration when you have to spend more than 30 mins out of the 3 hrs waiting for one order!!! Maybe in the future, be a little more understanding, and when asked by a person who is helping do your business and help it thrive, have a system in place where drivers can see how long an order will be from the scheduled pick up time given to them from the actual time you will have it ready!! Or just hire courteous ppl who can give a better answer than ""I don't know!! A couple mins. ""!!!",2023-01-19 00:00:00,1988.0,Widow,Yes,,150.0,176.0,High,On Foot,No

The portions are generous for a single meal (don't expect leftovers though) but the price is a bit high for what you get. It would get 3 stars except that they did not treat our family of 4 with 2 pleasant small children (a 3.5yr and a 6mo). At 6:30 pm on a Saturday, they made us wait 20 minutes to be seated while staring at empty tables in their side room (which was not completely empty or being reserved for an event) and then placed us in the loudest and busiest section of the restaurant while complaining about our stroller. Once we were seated, things went reasonably well but after we had finished eating, it took excessively long to get the check (which is problematic when you have kids beginning to get restless). I used to wait tables in a Chinese restaurant. I understand how staff scheduling and sections work. I can also understand that despite the liberal use of toys as decor, that a college town restaurant such as this isn't primary focused on catering to families. But, I also know that families with small children can be seen to with relatively few accommodations.

The crispy salmon on risotto and peas was delicious and was my bangers n mash - very tasty and tender sausages and delicious gravy. The corned beef and cabbage was also very good.

And it is some of the tastiest indo Chinese food we ate. The server was pretty nice and accommodated our additional request. However, besides ordering low-spicy chili garlic noodles, it was still pretty hot and difficult to eat. And we were not accommodated for that. The service was pretty slow which made our wait a little longer. For the price they offer, the quality is pretty much great.

We went there this past Saturday and both ordered the dish. I‚Äôm not sure if the owners are the same, but I sure know the dish was not. It‚Äôs now served in a bowl with a thicker mushroom sauce, more like gravy, poured on top. The sauce was hot but both of our pies were cold in the center and barley lukewarm on the edges. I honestly think they just heated up the mushroom sauce and poured it on top of unheated pies. The pie was swimming in the sauce, which most time I‚Äôd be happy about. However, the sauce was SO lemony that I could barely eat it. I like lemon but this was really unbalanced. I think both of us ate about 1/4 pie. We asked for to-go boxes because the server was really nice and neither one of us wanted to make her feel bad. We both tossed it in the trash when we got home.

Chongqing popcorn chicken: it's a huge meal even if you don't eat the abundant red chilis. Don't be scared off by the 3/3 hot rating. The chicken is wonderfully spicy but if you evade the chilis it seemed more like a 2/3.
House special pork stir fry was actually a bit hot for me-- I couldn't make it through the jalapenos (those aren't bell pepper!). The pork by itself was great.
The Kung Pao has tasty chicken, lots of peanuts, some chilis, and slices of ginger. It was very tasty although it has no Szechuan pepper.",2022-11-06 00:00:00,1972.0,Single,No,No,194.0,154.0,High,On Foot,No

After an hour of waiting, I called because I had to leave my home in 30 minutes. They told me it would be another 35 minutes, so I told them I needed to cancel because I would no longer be home at the time they could deliver. They then said it was almost pulled together and that they would have it to me in 20 minutes. However, the reality was that it took 45 more minutes before it was delivered and had to sit on my cold front porch till I got home. Clearly, they lied about the status of my food. If they had just told the truth and allowed me to cancel, they would have kept a regular customer. Instead, they chose to lie to keep the order, so they‚Äôve lost my future business. To add to the bad experience, they didn‚Äôt make good on the free delivery and fee desert they had promoted in an email.",2022-07-27 00:00:00,1987.0,Married,Yes,,210.0,200.0,Medium,Car Owner,No

The employees on the phone each time I called were polite and apologetic, stated the manager is off duty and when they txt him he said nothing can be done. It is crazy how door dash adds so many fees to a customer ,charges so much for service and I am sure the restaurant gets charged fees for their service too and then neither are able to refund or send the correct food. I was using a gift card today, I am so disappointed in the poor quality of care, bad business ethics and just down right unacceptable food service and management.

We started off with some chicken corn soup. The soup was of proper consistency and tasted well. The appetizer was fire cracker chicken, it's slightly crunchy, and spicy!! When I say spicy, it's spicy!! We got chicken indo Chino as an entree which has a black bean vase save, it was meaty, and it had lots of gravy. Our entree was paired with hakka noodles and Schezwan fried rice which went phenomenally well. For our vegetarian options we got spicy egg plant and vegetable gold coins, which tasted nothing less than gold!

1073,Kenneth Deane,Cozy Noodles and Rice,1,Sadly this place is bad for its business practice of adding 20% on to checks no matter the amount of people. I was there by myself and they added 20%. I objected because they‚Äôre taking away my right to tip what I felt was fair for the service. The owner who was there that day screamed at me saying ‚Äúhow am I suppose to make money‚Äù? I was shocked. She ended up taking the 20% off the bill because I stood my ground. I told her she lost a customer and I never returned.

Their spin on urban Thai fusion using authentic flavors provides an unique culinary experience that changed my understand of Thai flavors and ingredients. I Have never had a dish there I did not enjoy, which is rare considering I typically hate veggies and found myself loving all the food (even the ones that are vegetarian). Leave behind whatever preconceptions of Thai food from the westernized dishes that you typically see in a fast food or strip mall Thai restaurant. Their complex flavors using traditional ingredients and artistic presentation produces a fine dining experience in a casual setting. The staff are extremely friendly, providing exceptional service whenever we dine there. Great food, welcoming ambiance, and friendly service.

I sat at the bar and was greeted incredibly graciously by Jen, who explained to me in-depth the details (Zentli means Corn in Spanish), ingredients, and meaning of the entire menu, which is inspired directly from the chefs' mother and father.

Great pricing for amazing food, family like environment, with kind and attentive staff. I had the Flautas Palmar but will be back to try to entire menu haha. Would definitely recommend to anyone who loves Mexican food!",2023-03-01 00:00:00,2001.0,Single,No,,172.0,173.0,Medium,On Foot,No

I even reached out, multiple times to no avail, to the general manager of the hotel, Eric Smith. He has NEVER returned my calls or emails. Only sent an email about our overnight stay when I wrote a review that our sleep was disrupted due to barking dogs on our floor.

The teriyaki chicken and beef tasted like they boiled the chicken and beef and thrown sauce on top. It was placed on top of a wet iceberg lettuce with a side of old boiled carrots. Gomae ai was just flavorless sesame paste on top. The side salad (mostly iceberg lettuce) was also drenched with water making the lackluster dressing even more bland. Sashimi was ok but definitely not the freshest fish. Overall, food was definitely below average and not worth the price.

I don't understand why they had to consult someone regarding selling food? I noticed that they only had two bags of chips left but that still doesn't mean you can evaluate whom may purchase the food. Additionally the staff were rude, and laughed at me when I asked them to speak up and disclosed that I'm hearing impaired.

I understand jobs can make us stressed and we get tired after working long hours, but that‚Äôs no excuse to handle any paying costumers food that way.

When I questioned the employee that was preparing my bowl, she told me ‚Äúthis is how our avocados came this time‚Äù and actually had this on display for people to order.

And you can pick a great drink from boba tea to Thai iced tea or even BYOB. The aesthetic is quintessential kitschy and Instagram worthy (the decor and the food‚Äîstar shaped carrots?! Yes!). I will drive an hour from the suburbs for curb pick up alone. Highly recommend. Service is always wonderful and pricing is great, they package leftover conveniently as well.

For the employees there are other restaurants hiring but the fact you are fine segregating people is disgusting!

There is also a wide variety of dishes on the menu. The lemongrass wings were especially good. The chow fun was a little bit bland. The Shabu Shabu which they didn't have when we went is supposed to be really good.,2022-03-08 00:00:00,2003.0,Single,No,,140.0,171.0,Low,Car Owner,Yes

1433,Irma Brown,Taste of Nepal,4,"I had seen this restaurant while getting coffee. They had some interesting specials. I came with my mom to try it out. For free we had cumin jeera crackers with cilantro chutney and tamarind. For appetizer we ordered chili chicken momo. It's a fried dumpling filled with chicken and vegetables covered in a red, tomato, spicy, tangy sauce. Then we ordered chicken curry and lamb vindaloo with garlic Naan. I don't like to order chicken or lamb dishes outside because sometimes they have a gamey taste, but these two proteins were marinated in a ginger cardamom paste. They were soft and easy to split with the garlic Naan. The Naan had fresh garlic taste on top. If you like Indian Nepali food, you should check out this place.",2023-03-05 00:00:00,2002.0,Single,No,,207.0,155.0,Medium,On Foot,Yes
